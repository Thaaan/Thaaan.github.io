                        <p class="text-entry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the United States, two annual events stand out for their cultural significance and widespread appeal: Black Friday and the Super Bowl. Black Friday marks the beginning of the holiday shopping season, characterized by promotional sales and significant discounts. During this day, consumers across the nation flock to stores in search of deals, turning it into the busiest shopping days of the year. The NFL's  Super Bowl is one of the largest sporting events each year, attracting millions of viewers who throw parties and tune in to watch entertaining ads as well as the game. The signature dish of this event are chicken wings, over one billion of which are eaten every year during the game.</p>

                        <p class="text-entry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While these events are distinct in nature—one rooted in retail and the other in sports—they both highlight aspects of American consumer culture. Black Friday has become synonymous with the consumerist frenzy, often criticized for encouraging excessive spending and disregard for the environmental impact of mass consumption. The Super Bowl, beyond being a sports spectacle, has evolved into a showcase for consumerism through its extravagant advertisements and the significant consumption associated with Super Bowl parties and merchandise. Black Friday and the Super Bowl reflect and shape American consumer habits, highlighting its vast environmental impacts.</p>
