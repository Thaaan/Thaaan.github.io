					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Using the favorite website you chose in homework 1, create a wireframe for one page of it using pen/paper, PowerPoint, or any your tool of choice. (use the 'img' tag!) Make sure to let us know what the name of your website is (Use the 'p' tag!)</p>
							<a href="https://www.smartlinked.app/">SmartLinked</a>
							<img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/original.jpeg">
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Try to improve the website you've chosen, and create a redesigned wireframe of one page for the same website using the principles of visual hierarchy that you learned from the article.</p>

						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Responses</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is the goal of the website? Who is it intended for? How does the design accomplish this? Write 2-3 sentences answering these questions. (Use the 'p' tag again!)</p>
							<p> The goal of SmartLinked is to suggest improvements for the user's LinkedIn profile through generative AI. It is primarily aimed towards college students who may need help making a good LinkedIn for the first time. The current design accomplishes this by stating what we are and overall being aesthetically pleasing to draw in users. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Write 2-3 sentences about what problems your redesign addressed, and how it solved them.</p>
							<p> One big problem with the homepage is that it isn't interactable and doesn't display how SmartLinked can help first time users. I addressed this by adding a small trial page to give users something to interact with and hopefully draw first time users to create accounts. I also added a demonstration video that will properly display what SmartLinked can do, ideally it would be a built in animation but I left it as an embedded video for now. Some new problems from the redesign: I was forced to change the formatting in order to accomplish this so it looks messier and having both a trial and a video showing the user what we do is sorta redundant but at least it gives users options. </p>
						</li>
						<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure to include the wireframe images in the website and don't just put it in your assets folder!</p></li>
						<p>Your wireframes should look something like this:</p>
				<img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/wireframe.png"/>
