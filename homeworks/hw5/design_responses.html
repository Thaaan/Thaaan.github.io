                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> From looking at the design inspirations in the article I learned that many of them are very minimal. Another thing I learned was that the main focus of a lot of these pages was the text, many of the images used were mainly for aesthetic or to help the text pop. All the designs used some sort of visual, either videos or slides, in order to make the page more interesting and display more information. </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite part of this article was looking at the designs. I like how there is a variety between the designs: image/text focused, mobile and desktop, etc. The most interesting designs to me were the map ones since they seemed difficult to create. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> My favorite inspiration was "Dark" by BestServedBold. The visuals track your cursor and make it appear as if you are within a cave watching the character. Despite having so much going on it is still relatively minimalistic. I think the combination of the interactive visual and overall minimal design help to not only draw attention to the character within the show but also make you want to watch the show to learn more.  </p>
