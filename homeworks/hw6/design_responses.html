					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> The article provides a guide on using animations when creating webpages. One thing I learned is that the speed of your animations are very important. If it is too slow, users may feel bogged down and get frustrated. Meanwhile if it is too fast, it may be too confusing for the user. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I found it intriguing how the article pointed out the scarcity of comprehensive guides on interface animation. Many articles touch on specific cases, but few gather all the essential principles in one spot. The author's aim to consolidate these principles in one article really stood out to me. It seems like a valuable resource for anyone diving into interface animation. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Nowadays it’s hard to impress or even surprise with an interface animation. It shows interactions between screens, explains how to use the application or simply directs a user’s attention."" </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
