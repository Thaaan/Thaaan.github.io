					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that your text must have a 4:5:1 background to text contrast so that the majority of people are able to tell what you're saying. Another thing I learned regarding color is that you shouldn't rely only on color to convey messages. For example if there is an error or something related, don't just use the color red and add text along with it.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was the part where they say that you should have a 4:5:1 background to text contrast ratio. In the past I've always been told to not use yellow on a white background, but I never knew exactly what the threshold was for a color combination to be accepted. Now I am able to follow the 4:5:1 ratio and won't have to wonder anymore. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "In 2017, The World Health Organization estimated that roughly 217 million people live with some form of moderate to severe vision impairment. That statistic alone is reason enough to design for accessibility." </p>
						</li>
