				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I learned that many websites, specifically webstores, utilize dark patterns to increase engagement by tricking users. They may do this by adding trick buttons, disguising ads, making free memberships extremely hard to find, etc. Many of these designs seek to exploit users in order to increase profits. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> My favorite part of the article was the Privacy Zuckering section. I found it interesting because Facebook was exposed pretty recently and the event already has a name. It is also pretty relatable since I always agree to terms of service without reading them which is the basis of this dark pattern. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> "In his book, he speaks about the power of persuasive design and explains how a good understanding of cognitive science can add value to the userâ€™s experience." </p>
					</li>
				</ul>
